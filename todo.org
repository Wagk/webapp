* Webapp
* High Concept
  + schoolbus-like service for working parents, so they can work longer
    * Use case is for kids undergoing therapy because their sessions aren't
      long enough to count as childcare
    * Some therapy services also require the parents of the child to pick up their
      children in person, which also causes scheduling problems
  + app would track location of child (?)
  + app would be responsible for scheduling the pickup/handover of the children
  + app would arrange locatio
* Brainstorming
  - airbnb for daycare
  - some form of chat client for people with autistic kids
